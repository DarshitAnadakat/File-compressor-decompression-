### Introduction
To reduce the time needed for files to be transmitted over a network, Compression and Decompression techniques are very useful. Developers prefer to write code to compress files before sending them out to the network for a file upload process. Web applications get the most benefit out of it. The ```.NET``` Framework provides the ```System.IO.Compression``` namespace, which contains the compressing and decompressing libraries and streams. Developers can use these types to read and modify the contents of a compressed file.

# Project Requirements
### Java  programming language
Java is the number 1 programming language and development platform. It reduces costs, shortens development timeframes, drives innovation, and improves application services. With millions of developers running more than 51 billion Java Virtual Machines worldwide, Java continues to be the development platform of choice for enterprises and developers. You sholud have basic knowledge of coding and syntax formats of java for this project. And you should have **JDK version 19** or newer installed on your machine.
- Install JDK from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Download Intellij IDE from [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Download JavaFx from [gluonhq.com](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
### JavaFX GUI

For the user interface I used JavaFX which is a set of graphics and media packages that enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications that operate consistently across diverse platforms. You can use your favorite editor or any integrated development environment (IDE) that supports the Java language (such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA) to create and edit JavaFX applications or you can use third-party application to edit ``` .fxml ``` file like Scene builder which is a visual layout tool that lets users quickly design JavaFX application user interfaces, without coding knowledge.
- Download Scene builder from [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javafxscenebuilder-1x-archive-downloads.html)
